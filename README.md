# NEP-Hydro-Climate

This repository contains scripts for hydrological modeling and climate change assessment for small hydropower projects in Nepal. A process-based hydrological model (HBV) is used to simulate streamflow under historical and future climate scenarios, enabling assessment of changes in key design flood statistics under future climate conditions.

## Overview of Scripts

The repository is organized into four categories: data preprocessing, model calibration and simulation, figure generation, and core model implementation.
